# Ghost in the Shell - Project Overview

## Executive Summary

**Ghost in the Shell** is a personal AI fine-tuning project that creates a digital doppelgänger capable of mimicking the user's authentic conversation style. The project takes a refreshingly simple approach: directly fine-tune a small language model (Mistral-7B) on personal chat messages to replicate natural conversation patterns, tone, and multilingual code-switching behavior.

**Key Achievement**: Successfully fine-tuned Mistral-7B-v0.3 using QLoRA on ~70k personal messages, achieving stable convergence (loss reduction from 3.4 → 2.0) in ~4 hours for ~$20 on cloud GPU.

## Project Philosophy: "Simple Works Better"

This project deliberately avoids the complexity typical of personal AI systems:

- ❌ **No Complex RAG**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation adds unnecessary complexity
- ❌ **No Hybrid Architectures**: Hard to debug and maintain
- ❌ **No Over-engineered Chunking**: Breaks conversation flow
- ❌ **No Expensive Infrastructure**: Cost-effective cloud training approach

- ✅ **Direct Fine-tuning**: More effective than RAG for personal voice replication
- ✅ **Rolling Context**: Simple conversation history management (~20 turns)
- ✅ **JSONL Format**: Clean, debuggable conversation chunks
- ✅ **Two-Speaker Model**: A: (user) and B: (everyone else)
- ✅ **QLoRA Training**: Efficient 4-bit quantization with LoRA adapters

## Data Processing Pipeline

### Stage 1: Message Extraction (`01_message_parsing.ipynb`)

**Input Sources**:
- WhatsApp: TXT export files (regex parsing with timestamp handling)
- Telegram: JSON export files (structured data extraction)
- Messenger: Facebook's nested JSON structure

**Processing Steps**:
1. **Parse** different export formats with platform-specific handlers
2. **Clean and normalize** text while preserving emojis and authentic style
3. **Detect language** per conversation (French/English classification)
4. **Filter** system messages, media notifications, and very short messages
5. **Sanitize usernames** while maintaining speaker identity
6. **Output** standardized CSV format: `timestamp`, `sender`, `message`

**Key Features**:
- **Emoji Preservation**: Maintains authentic digital communication style
- **Multilingual Support**: Natural French/English detection and handling
- **PII Protection**: Username cleaning while preserving conversation patterns
- **Format Standardization**: Unified CSV output regardless of source platform

### Stage 2: Training Data Preparation (`02_prepare_messages.ipynb`)

**Input**: Standardized CSV files from Stage 1

**Processing Steps**:
1. **Speaker Normalization**: User identifiers → A:, others → B: (configurable via `user_config.json`)
2. **Message Merging**: Consecutive messages from same speaker within 3 minutes
3. **Conversation Segmentation**: Split on gaps ≥ 30 minutes
4. **Rolling Window Generation**: Create training samples with 6-12 message context windows
5. **JSONL Formatting**: Prepare samples for completion-style training
6. **Dataset Splitting**: Chronological split (90% train, 10% validation)

**Key Features**:
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains conversation flow and natural boundaries ✅ *[Verified: segmentation logic]*
- **Configurable Identity**: User can define their identifiers in `config/user_config.json` ✅ *[Verified: user_config.json]*
- **Multiple Window Sizes**: 6, 8, 10, 12 messages with stride=3 for variety ✅ *[Verified: notebook line 464]*
- **Proper Target Format**: Ensures samples end with B: and target is A: response ✅ *[Verified: lines 245-248]*

## Training Results & Performance

### Training Metrics
- **Initial Loss**: ~3.4
- **Final Loss**: ~2.0 (stable convergence)
- **Training Duration**: 16 hours on H100 (final training)
- **Cost**: ~$48 final training (16h × $3/h), ~$150 total with experimentation
- **VRAM Usage**: ~7.5 GiB (efficient memory usage)
- **Throughput**: ~1500 tokens/sec
- **Convergence**: Smooth, no overfitting or gradient explosions

### Dataset Statistics
- **Total Messages Processed**: ~70k across multiple conversations
- **Training Samples**: ~52k windows + instruct seeds
- **Languages**: French/English with natural code-switching
- **Platforms**: WhatsApp, Telegram (extensible to Messenger)
- **Context Coverage**: 95% of conversations fit within 1024 tokens

### Quality Assessment (Current Status)
⚠️ **Initial Testing Challenges**: The project experienced initial inference issues where the model would generate entire conversations rather than single responses. This led to a comprehensive debugging process and extended training strategy.

**Root Cause Analysis Revealed**:
- **Undertraining**: 1 epoch was insufficient for learning personal patterns
- **Format Learning**: Model needed more exposure to proper conversation boundaries
- **Parameter Tuning**: Generation parameters required optimization for controlled output

**Solution Implemented**: Extended training to 8 epochs with improved configuration.

## Deployment Architecture

### LoRA Merging & Model Export
- **Custom Merge Script**: `merge_lora_fp16.py` handles PEFT compatibility issues
- **Output Format**: Clean FP16 model (Hugging Face format)
- **Model Size**: ~14GB (Mistral-7B FP16)
- **Deployment Ready**: Compatible with Hugging Face Hub, Replicate, local serving

### Deployment Options

1. **Hugging Face Hub**: Private repository for model storage
2. **Replicate**: Cloud deployment with `cog.yaml` configuration
